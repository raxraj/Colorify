## Let's Colorify

Let's jump right into coloring your Webpage using our built-in classes.

### Material Colors

The Material Design color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. Theyâ€™ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

A single material design color is made up of a hue such as "red", and shade, such as "500".

#### Background Color

You may add a Background color with "red" hue and "500" shade by adding `.cy-bg-mt-red500` class in your HTML Element.

```html
<div class="cy-bg-mt-red500">Hello World</div>
```

#### Text Color

You may change your Text color to "red" hue and "500" shade by adding `.cy-text-mt-red500` class in your HTML Element.

```html
<div class="cy-text-mt-red500">Hello World</div>
```
