## Let's Colorify

Let's jump right into coloring your Webpage using our built-in classes.

### Material Colors

The Material Design color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. They’ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other.

A single material design color is made up of a hue such as "red", and shade, such as "500".

#### Background Color

You may add a Background color with "red" hue and "500" shade by adding `.cy-bg-mt-red500` class in your HTML Element.

```html
<div class="cy-bg-mt-red500">Hello World</div>
```

#### Text Color

You may change your Text color to "red" hue and "500" shade by adding `.cy-text-mt-red500` class in your HTML Element.

```html
<div class="cy-text-mt-red500">Hello World</div>
```
